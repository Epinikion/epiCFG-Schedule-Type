# epiCFG Schedule Type Script

This repository contains the `epiCFG_schedule_type.py` script, designed to be used with [automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). It provides various schedule types for controlling image generation processes in diffusion models.

It's a bit hacky and not well designed, but i'm no python expert.

## Features

- **Multiple Scheduling Options**: Includes diverse scheduling types such as Linear, Clamp-Linear, Inverse-Linear, PCS, Cosine, Sine, V-Shape, A-Shape, and Interval schedules.
- **Multiple Selection**: You can select multiple schedules and the script will process them.

## Installation

1. put the script into the **webui\scripts** Folder

## Usage ##

Simply select the Script and choose your desired Schedule Type modifier.
